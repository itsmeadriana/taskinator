# taskinator

## Purpose

Need to keep track of your to-do list as you get through all of your tasks? Use taskinator to add tasks with category types such as Personal, School, or Home. Then track your progress by editing your task's status from the drop-down menu. Feel free to edit and delete tasks as often as needed, and--best of all--the taskinator will save your tasks for you so a refreshed page won't disrupt your flow!
